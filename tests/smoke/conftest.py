"""Fixtures for the hermetic smoke suite.

The suite runs against the ``docker-compose.smoke.yml`` topology: a real
orchestrator and the agents (driven by real Gemini), with the external
boundaries (Jira MCP, Jira REST, Zephyr, Qdrant + embedding) replaced by
recording mocks. The fixtures wait for all agents to register, then fire the
four webhooks once, concurrently, for correctness independence between flows —
though requirements review and the test-case flow share the orchestrator's single
pipeline queue, so one can still delay the other's start (see the RECORD_POLL_TIMEOUT
note in test_smoke.py). The test functions read the mocks' ``/__recorded`` endpoints
and assert on what reached each boundary.

URLs default to the published compose ports and are overridable via ``SMOKE_*``
env vars. The dashboard/API credentials are the fixed throwaway values baked into
``docker-compose.smoke.yml``.
