"""Concurrent pipeline E2E tests.

Verifies that when two test-case-generation webhooks arrive simultaneously, the
orchestrator dispatches both to the agent without serial blocking, and the agent
processes them in parallel without state pollution or log cross-contamination.

Design:
  - 2 pipeline webhooks are sent at the same time.
  - We record the wall-clock time T0 just before sending.
  - We assert:
      1. Both webhooks return 202 (accepted).
      2. At least 2 generation agent tasks appear in the dashboard history with
         start times AFTER T0 — proving the orchestrator dispatched both.
      3. At least one of those generation tasks completes successfully — proving
         the agent can handle concurrent work without crashing.
      4. The two tasks started within 60 s of each other — if they were serial,
         the 2nd would start only after the 1st finished (~6 min later).
